# IMPORTANT

This project is a twitter clone in node and vue-cli. It was done as a University project during a web development course 
as part of the 6th semester of my bachelor in computer science. 70% of it was developed in the span of ten days so clean code
was not the priority.

There are mix of French and english in the whole project. I updated the dependencies a bit but this repository exists mainly as
an archive. It will most likely not be revisited but it was fun back then.
